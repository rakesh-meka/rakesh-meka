## 🚀 About Me
I’m someone who enjoys **building logic before building models**.  
My interest lies in understanding how data behaves, how patterns emerge, and how machine learning models can be made both **accurate and explainable**.

I currently work with **Python, data analysis, and machine learning fundamentals**, focusing on writing clean code, experimenting with models, and improving results through feature engineering and evaluation. I believe strong basics, consistent practice, and real-world thinking matter more than shortcuts.

I use GitHub as a **daily learning log** — to practice, experiment, break things, and improve.
